                    <h3 style="column-count: 2; text-align: justify; ">The rate of technological progress has brought the field of online education a long way since our original article. While the characteristics we discussed remain relevant, more have come to the fore. Here are the top characteristics of a virtual classroom that we would add to our list in 2019.
                        Even a few years ago, having a mobile-optimized virtual classroom wouldn’t have been a requirement. But times have changed, and if your learners can’t access your course from their mobile devices, both of you are missing out. Mobile accessibility allows your learners greater flexibility in where and how they learn—and that benefits you as much as them, because it means they have more opportunities to engage with your materials.
                        This applies across your learning environment. Whereas in the past, your learners might have viewed forums as places for long-form discussion, now they’re more likely to treat them like an extension of their messaging app. Audio lessons are consumed like podcasts, and mini quizzes are micro games that can be played during a lunch break.
